# WeatherWise-Dashboard

# Overview

The Weather Dashboard is a web application that provides users with the current and future weather conditions for a searched city. It utilizes the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data based on the user's query. This project is designed to demonstrate the ability to work with APIs, asynchronous programming, and dynamic HTML/CSS.

# Features

Current Weather Conditions: Displays the city name, date, an icon representation of weather conditions, temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
5-Day Forecast: Shows the date, weather condition icons, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.
Search History: Saves the user's search queries and allows easy access to previously searched cities' weather conditions.
